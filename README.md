# Python-sending-results-by-email
Python sending test results or program output by email

Using this program, you could send local files such as test results, data files, xcel, documents to any email address.
To send email , you need access to email client program; we will use sendemail program to send email.
We also need access to SMTP server; we will use google's server.
We will login to gmail's SMTP server using our gmail account information (you need a gmail account).
If you are sending multiple files, I suggest to use winzip to compress all files into ONE file.
A test has been done using gmail, winzip program. Email was sent successfully.

Notes: 
When using gmail, you might need to set gmail settings:  account allow less secure apps: ON.

You could download sendemail program from here:

SendEmail will use your google login information; suggest to use a shareable google account.
You could use windows batch file to create a folder, copy files to it and send by email.
