# Python-sending-results-by-email
Python sending test results or program output by email

Using this program, you could send local files such as test results, data files, xcel, documents to any email address
To send email , you need access to email client program; we will use sendemail program to send email
We also need access to SMTP server; we will use google's server
We will login to gmail's SMTP server usign our gmail account information (you need a gmail account)
If we are sending multiple files, I suggest we use winzip to compress all files into ONE file
A test has been done using gmail, winzip program

Notes: 
When using gmail, you might need to set gmail settings:  account allow less secure apps: ON
